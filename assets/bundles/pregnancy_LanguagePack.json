   "Question_EN": "Are you pregnant this week?",
   "Answer_EN": "If you conceive this week, you'll be two weeks pregnant. That's because healthcare providers use your last menstrual period to determine your due date, so technically the first day of your period is also the first day of your pregnancy. Since you ovulate about two weeks into your cycle, conception happens around the time you're two weeks pregnant – which means pregnancy starts before you've conceived.",
   "Question_TC": "你是不是在這週懷孕了?",
   "Answer_TC": "如果你這週懷孕，你已經懷孕兩週。 這是是因為醫護人員以您最後一次月經期來確定您的預產期，從醫學上的計算，你月經的第一天也是你懷孕的第一天。 由於你在周期約兩週內排卵，因此懷孕發生在你受孕兩週左右，這意味著懷孕在你受孕之前已經開始。"

   "Question_TC": "最佳的受孕時間",
   "Answer_TC": "排卵通常發生在月經週期的中間。 所以在排卵期前後3天內就是備孕的黃金受孕期。正在排卵的跡象可能體溫變化、乳房脹痛、輕度痙攣或者陰道分泌物增多。"

   "Question_EN": "When can I take a pregnancy test?",
   "Answer_EN": "By the end of this week you may be able to get a positive pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests work by detecting the presence of a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine. Most home pregnancy tests claim to be accurate on the day you miss your period, but even then, the amount of hCG in urine at this time can vary a great deal from one woman to another. If you test too soon, you may get a false negative pregnancy test or an unclear result like a faint line. If this happens, test again in a few days.",
   "Question_TC": "我什麼時候可以使用驗孕棒驗孕?",
   "Answer_TC": "這個週末，您可能使用驗孕棒進行驗孕。驗孕棒內含有檢測尿液中的人絨毛膜促性腺激素(簡稱HCG) 來發揮功能，大多數驗孕棒聲稱在錯過月經的那一天是準確，即使如此，尿液中的(HCG) 含量可能因女性而異，如果太早使用驗孕棒進行驗孕，可能會出現假懷孕試驗或像一條微弱的線般不清楚的驗孕結果。 如果發生這種情況， 建議幾天後再使用驗孕棒進行驗孕。"
